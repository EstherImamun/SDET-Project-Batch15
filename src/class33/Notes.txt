Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behaviour which occurs at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.
Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime errors and helps us convert complex error messages
    to something simpler that a normal user can understand.
How do we implement exception handling in java:
    We have new keywords and new blocks of code which allows us handle exceptions in java.
    Blocks of code   1.try  2.catch  3.finally
    Keywords        1.throw  2.throws
try block:
    In the try block we write the code which may throw an exception
catch block:
     It contains the backup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. It can also contain code to
     simplify the error messages. it can also contain the code which might send a notification or an email to
     the developers or admins in case of failure.
How it works:
     We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block. Each handling a different error.
     We can also put a last catch block with exception class so that if something goes wrong and there is no specific
     catch block to handle it, the Exception one will handle it.

finally block:
     Finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block.
     We should put cleanup code inside the finally blocks like closing a browser, closing the database connection e.t.c.
