Set:
   Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets;
   1. HashSet  2. LinkedHashSet  3. TreeSet

HashSet: (Most widely used)
   Upside:      Speed. It's the fastest
   Downside:    It does not maintain the insertion order

LinkedHashSet:
   Upside:       maintains the insertion order
   Downside:     Slower than HashSet

TreeSet:
   Upside:       Keeps the data sorted
   Downside:     It's slower than all

Map:
   Maps allows us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets, we have three main types of maps
   as well. 1. HashMap   2. LinkedHashMap  3. TreeMap

HashMap: (Most widely used)
   Upside:      Speed. It's the fastest
   Downside:    It does not maintain the insertion order

LinkedHashMap:
   Upside:       maintains the insertion order
   Downside:     Slower than HashSet

TreeMap:
   Upside:       Keeps the data sorted
   Downside:     It's slower than all
