When we should use String class:
    when we want to save as much memory aas possible and we are ok if the programme gets a little slow.

When should we use StringBuilder class:
    when we want maximum speed and we don't care how much memory our programs will occupy.

What does it mean by String is immutable:
     It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer, and the reason they are immutable
     is because same memory cell can be shared across many variebles and if we allow any of the variables to change
     the value, it can break the complete system.
