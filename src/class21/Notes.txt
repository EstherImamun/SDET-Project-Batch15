Super Keyword:
    is used to refer to the parent class members like field methods and constructors.
When should we use "super" or "this" keyword:
    Whenever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class, we can use super keyword to explicitly
    refer to parent class variables, methods or constructors.
Note:
    By default, Java prefers local variables, if not available, then it prints the instance variables from the same
    class and if what you're looking to print is also not available int the instance variable, then it prints the
    instance variables and methods from the parent class.

Method overloading:
    Method overloading happens when same name method exist in a class with different parameters.
We can overload methods in 3 different ways:
   1. By changing the number of parameters.
   2. By changing the data types.
   3.By changing the sequence of parameters.
Why should we overload a method or constructor?
   Clean code and flexibility to the end user.
Some important tools we need when we start learning Selenium:
   if else conditions
   loops
   arrays
   methods
   String class methods
   inheritance
