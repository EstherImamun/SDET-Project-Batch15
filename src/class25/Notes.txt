Abstraction:
     Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
     In java, we can achieve this in two ways.
     1.  Abstract classes
     2.  Interface.
Interface:
     It is very similar to an abstract class. we can have private methods, static methods, default methods, abstract
     methods, we can have static in an interface. we can't have instance fields in an interface and
     because we don't have instance fields, we also can't have a constructor in an interface.
When we should use interfaces:
     When objects are closely related to each other and there is a "Is a " relationship between classes , then we
     should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. If Objects are not related to each other, then we
     should implement abstraction with the help of interfaces
