Iterator:

Sets like HashSet, linkedHashSet and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values
There are 3 main types of Sets;
   1. HashSet:
      Upside:    It's very fast
      Downside:  Does not retain the insertion order

   2. LinkedHashSet:
      Upside:    Retains the insertion order
      Downside:  It's slower than HashSet

   3. TreeSet:
      Upside:    It keeps the data sorted
      Downside:  It's the slowest.
