Methods in Java:
          is just a collection of java statement and blocks of code like if else, loops, printlns etc
WhyWhy should we learn about methods:
          1.  it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them,
          build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
          2.  Methods allow us to re-use code.
          3.  Methods allow us to be flexible.

   How can we create Methods?
          There are two types, Built-in and User defined.
Built-in methods?
          The methods which are designed by Java developers. for example: the println(), nextInt(),method in the
          Scanner class, length() present in String clas, They are all built-in methods.
   User defined Methods:
          The methods that we write.
Methods which returns something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.


int add(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}

int => return type of a method
add =>name of the method
(int a, intb)=>parameters of the method or the input to the method
{=>body of the method
}

Rules:
return types and the values we are returning form a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are three types of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
     if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc,
     they are called local variables.
upside:
     local variable occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.You should always
     try to write code with the help of local variables.
Downside:
     They can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created.They have very limited scope.
Instance variables:
     All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables.

static variables:
     All the variables which are outside of methods and have static keyword are called static variables
