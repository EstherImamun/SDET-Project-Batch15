Arrays in Java:
      Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use indexes to get back the values.
Why should we learn the Arrays:
      if we have to store a lot of values, it becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
Syntax of Arrays:
      We can create Arrays in two different ways.
First way of creating arrays:
      DataType[] arr={element 1, element 2, element 3};
      System.out.println(array[0])
Second way of creating Arrays:
      DataType[] arr=new Datatype[size]
Notes:
      Other than using loops, we can also use below syntax
       int[] arr = {10, 13, 20, 25, 45, 50};
              // Below code prints all the elements from an array without a loop
              System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
