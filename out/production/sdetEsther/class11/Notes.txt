2D Arrays:
     2D Arrays are arrays that contain 1D arrays.
Why we should learn about 2D arrays:
     Because they allow us to store multiple 1D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
     for example, if we have to store data from Excel files, we can use 2D arrays.
Syntax to create 2D Arrays:
First way:
     DataType[][] nameOfArray=new DataType[Size of Rows][];
Second way:
     DataType[][] nameOfArray={{data,data,data},{data,data,},{data,data,data,data}};

OOP (means Object-Oriented Parts) is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow, we achieve below.
      1. Representing real life entities becomes easier.
      2. Code repetition is minimized
      3. Changing existing code and adding new features becomes easier.
      4. Helps us write secure codes.
